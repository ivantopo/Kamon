/**
  * A Span encapsulates information about an operation performed by the application and its relationship to other
  * operations. At the most basic level, all Spans have an operation name and they are bound to the time taken by the
  * application to perform that operation, meaning that they have start and end time time stamps.
  *
  * Spans connect to each other creating a hierarchical structure of operations, where an operation can have several
  * child operations but only one parent operation. Furthermore, all related Spans share the same Trace information.
  *
  * Spans can be enriched with two types of information: tags and marks. Tags are key/value pairs that give additional
  * information about the operation; for example, a Span that represents an HTTP request could have tags that indicate
  * the full request URL, the response status code and the size of the payload, information that might come handy when
  * analyzing and troubleshooting issues using the trace data. Marks represent events related to the operation and they
  * are bound to a specific instant in time; for example, a mark could be used to indicate the instant when a connection
  * was established, when the SSL handshake finished and when the payload was transferred for a single HTTP request
  * operation.
  *
  * Optionally, Spans can generate metrics about the processing time of the operations they represent. By default, all
  * Spans will generate metrics unless they are explicitly disabled. Since metrics are very susceptible to high
  * cardinality tags, the Spans handle two different sets of tags: the Span tags that can have any sort of information
  * (like URLs, user ids and so on) and the metric tags which should only include information with low cardinality (like
  * HTTP status codes or operation names).
  *
  * Once a Span is finished it will be flushed to the Span reporters and, if metrics stayed enabled, the processing time
  * of the Span will be recorded on the "span.processing-time" metric with all provided metric tags in addition to the
  * operationName and error tags which are always added.
